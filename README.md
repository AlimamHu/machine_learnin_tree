* all Regression Allgorithm use 
* Quick look theory part
* all Regression Allgorithm use again mind but you know how it work & why.
* all Important point cover What, why & how . (pros & coes)
## Deep Dive into the Regression  it make you Advance level player in the game.
* make Algorithms from skreatch.
* & do a few projects for real world exprences. 

Notics :- You must perelley learn the some statistics & Probabilty use below link

After Finishing above topic you changing you level expert to max expert in Regression 


# All Regression Allgorithm use for how to use it.
(because it make question on your brain to help in study. this is also work)

**so, what is Regression? rise in you mind.**

Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). 

This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables.

## Types of Regression 
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Stepwise Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* ElasticNet Regression
